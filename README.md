## Project Explaination

This project is able to create order objects that are able to create a list of pizzas with unique IDs. It is then able to get information about the pizzas in the list.

Each pizza has a default topping list and price, but can be ammended with additional toppings and a cooking method. The pizza calculates a final price based off of all of the other information.

Once all pizzas in the order have a cooking method associated with them, the user can checkout.

### Project Dependencies:

The only dependencies for this project are the default Java JRE System Library jars.

### Running the Program:

Because the Main function does not do anything useful on it's own, the Eclipse project enclosed may be opened and the Main can be edited to test code (default is expansion of the ) and the project can be run as a normal Eclipse project with no modifications. 

The packages may also be imported into another project to be used as a library.
